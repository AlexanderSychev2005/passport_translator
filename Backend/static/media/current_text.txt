The centre of Crimean Orthodoxy, one of the oldest churches on the Crimean peninsula, the centre of religious life for Christians in the Crimean Khanate - all this is about the Bakhchisaray Holy Dormition Monastery.
The oldest cave temple and the monastery itself were named the Assumption Monastery in honour of the great event - the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.Â 
For hundreds of years, no visitor to Bakhchisarai has missed the opportunity to visit the holiest place in the city - the Assumption Cave Monastery. 3 legends and tales, miracles and suffering are associated with this monastery, and this holy place has undergone periods of prosperity and decline over the 12 centuries c its existence.
The subject of my work is the Holy Dormition Monastery, a working monument of Christianity in Crssssssimea.
